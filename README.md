# List of Denial of Service (DoS) Tools 
The main goal of this repository is to facilitate the access to existing DoS tools. Some of the original links are not working anymore. For this reason we downloaded the tools and make them available. 

Some of these tools are still used in campaigns or operations (#op...) by scriptkiddies (skiddies). **Therefore, it is important to emphacise that performing DDoS attack is (usually) a crime.** One exception is to use these tools in a closed environment, usually for researching purpose. There are another very few exceptions. Contact me (j.j.santanna@utwente.nl) if you want to know more.

Here is the list of DoS tools that we have collected:
